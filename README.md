Markdown demo for ProDev week 10

## My favourite games :video_game:

1. **Just Cause 3**  
   [LOOK AT ALL THE EXPLOSIONS](https://youtu.be/mK9gdY9xkBg?t=206)
2. **Animal Crossing: New Horizons**  
   Because we all need an escape from reality
3. **Watch Dogs 2**  
   Because we all need a grim reminder of what's almost reality
4. **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe**  
   Don't at me, it's the best Mario Kart game (and I grew up with both Mario Kart Wii and DS!)
